This repository contains a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack Todo App. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. It consists of a backend server built with Express.js and a frontend client built with React.js. The server connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data persistence. The client communicates with the server through RESTful APIs using axios for HTTP requests.

Features:

--Create new todo items with a title and description.
--View a list of all todo items.
--Update existing todo items by editing their title and description.
--Delete todo items.
--User-friendly interface built with React components.
--API integration with the backend server using axios.

Instructions for running the application:
